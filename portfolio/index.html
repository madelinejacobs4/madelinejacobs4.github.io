      <h2>Soul and Bones Collaboration</h2>
      <p>For this project, I took a multimedia art piece I created as part of a collaborative jewelry business and transformed it into a line of custom phone cases. To keep the design authentic and connected to the brand, I incorporated her logo and colors inspired by her Instagram and website aesthetic. The goal was to bring the unique textures, colors, and details of the original art into something people can carry with them every day. Working closely with the artist, we made sure the phone cases stayed true to her brand’s style while also being durable. This project is about more than just selling phone cases, it’s about blending art and everyday life.
